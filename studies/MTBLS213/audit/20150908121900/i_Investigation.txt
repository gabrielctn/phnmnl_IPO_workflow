STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS213"
Study Title	"geoRge: a computational tool for stable isotope labelling detection in LC/MS-based untargeted metabolomics"
Study Description	"Here we describe a novel approach for the annotation and relative quantification of isotope-labelled mass spectrometry data that benefits from a simple trait of the labelled mass spectra when compared to the unlabelled ones: spectral peaks produced by labelled metabolites show higher intensity and may even appear anew in the mass spectra. The automated untargeted isotope annotation and relative quantification capabilities of geoRge are demonstrated by the analysis of LC/MS data from a human retinal pigment epithelium cell line (ARPE-19) grown on normal and high glucose concentrations that mimics diabetic retinopathy conditions in vitro."
